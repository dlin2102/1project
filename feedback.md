## Code Comments:

Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**2: Performing.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**2: Performing.** Your application satisfied all of the technical requirements well. I would suggest
going back and adding some new features like a running scoreboard, randomizing the order of questions,
maybe a flying Likitu, but overall your app really impressed me.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**2: Performing.** Your code is semantic, neatly written, fairly modular, and free of bugs. I would only suggest
looking into a more programmatic approach for cycling through the questions (imagine if we wanted there
 to be 100 questions, we wouldn't want to have to hard-code all of that HTML). Very good job though.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**3: Excelling.** Your app is very well styled and presents a pleasant user experience. I particularly like
the animated background and that it automatically and smoothly advanced on user answers. Only possible
improvements would be in the font styling, adding a few UI elements like a running scoreboard, and
making it responsive on browser resize.
