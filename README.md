# International Trivia Game
*by Dan Lin*

<!-- Change the header to a more descriptive name for your project and put your name under it -->
<!-- Also, look into using markdown (shorthand HTML) to format your readme.md -->
## Technologies used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery

## Approach taken:
 - First, I mapped out the barebones of the project. What I needed to have vs. what it would be nice to have.

<!-- Add more content here. Focus on what processes / tools you used for planning (wireframing,
  trello, user stories, etc.). -->

## Installation instructions:
 - This has jquery installed.

<!-- Add more here to walk someone through the process of finding your repo, clonging
it down, and opening it locally on their browser (you can assume they are familiar
 with GitHub / git) -->

## Unsolved problems:
 - I wanted Lakitu to run out with a traffic light and have the traffic light go from red to green and increment that change with sound. But that's a little ambitious.


## User Stories
1. As an user, I should be able to see the number of questions I've gotten correct.
2. As an user, I should be able to restart the game.
3. When I click on choice, it should take me the next question.
4. Lakitu should pop up at the end to give me my results.
5. When I restart, my past choices should be cleared.

<!-- Good user stories. -->
