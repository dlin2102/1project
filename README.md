# 1project
Technologies used:
I used html, css, and javascript.

Approach taken:
First, I mapped out the barebones of the project. What I needed to have vs. what it would be nice to have.


Installation instructions:
This has jquery installed.

Unsolved problems:
 I wanted Lakitu to run out with a traffic light and have the traffic light go from red to green and increment that change with sound. But that's a little ambitious.


User Stories
1. As an user, I should be able to see the number of questions I've gotten correct.
2. As an user, I should be able to restart the game.
3. When I click on choice, it should take me the next question.
4. Lakitu should pop up at the end to give me my results.
5. When I restart, my past choices should be cleared.
